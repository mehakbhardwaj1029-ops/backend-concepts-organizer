A  **personal tech journaling platform** where you can create topics, write code, and maintain clean documentation — all in one place. This project is designed for developers who want to **document their learning journey**, avoid relearning concepts from scratch, and build a habit of structured thinking.

---

## Why this project exists

> *"Documenting your learnings can do wonders for your brain."*

While learning new technologies, we often move fast and forget details later. This project solves that by letting you:

* Create **topics** (e.g., JWT, Rate Limiting, JVM Internals)
* Attach **code snippets** with a real editor
* Write **clean documentation** 
* Revisit and evolve your understanding over time

---

##  Tech Stack

### Frontend

* **React (Vite)** – fast dev experience
* **Tailwind CSS** – modern UI styling
* **React Router** – page navigation
* **Monaco Editor** – VS Code–like code editor
* **TipTap Editor** – clean documentation writing experience
* **Lucide Icons** – modern icons

### Backend

* **Spring Boot** – REST APIs
* **SQL Database** – topic persistence

---

##  Database Design

```sql
CREATE TABLE topic (
  id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
  code TEXT,
  docs TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites



For Backend

# Prerequisites

Spring Boot 3.x

Spring Web

Spring Data JPA

MySQL connector 

Lombok

SQL Database

```bash

# navigate to backend
cd backend

#run using maven wrapper
./mvnw spring-boot:run

```

# backend server will start at 
  http://localhost:1234

For Frontend 

# Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18+ recommended)
* npm or yarn


```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-backend-journey.git

# Move into the project directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

# Open your browser at:
  http://localhost:5173


# Intended Use Cases

* Backend learning notes
* System design explanations
* API behavior documentation
* Debugging notes
* Interview preparation
* Personal knowledge base

---

# Future Enhancements

* Autosave functionality
* Topic search & filtering
* Version history for docs/code
* Authentication & user profiles

This project focuses on:

* **Clarity over complexity**
* **Learning over aesthetics**
* **Long-term knowledge retention**

It’s built for developers who care about *understanding* systems — not just using them.

Pull requests are welcome.
If you have ideas to improve developer learning workflows, feel free to open an issue.

If this project saves you from relearning something again — it has already done its job.

Happy documenting!!
